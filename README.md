# RoboTrader


## Algorithmic Trading Bot

In this project, I combined my AWS skills with my existing Python superpowers to create a bot that will recommend an investment portfolio for a retirement plan.

I accomplished the following main tasks:

Configured the initial robo advisor: Defined an Amazon Lex bot with a single intent that establishes a conversation about requirements to suggest an investment portfolio for retirement.

Built and tested the robo advisor: Made sure that the bot works and accurately responds during the conversation with the user.

Enhanced the robo advisor with an Amazon Lambda function: Created an Amazon Lambda function that validates the user's input and returns the investment portfolio recommendation. This included testing the Amazon Lambda function and integrating it with the bot.
